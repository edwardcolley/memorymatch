# Super Sloth Memory Match

A sloth-themed memory match game with real-time statistic generation. It is played by matching 9 pairs of 18 cards that are face down. Once a pair is made, the two cards will remain face up. Upon finding all the pairs, a modal will display informing the user that they have won. An option is then given to either play again, which resets stats and increments the games played, or not play, which simply exits the modal. Should the user wish to resume playing if they have exited the modal, a reset button is available in the stats container
